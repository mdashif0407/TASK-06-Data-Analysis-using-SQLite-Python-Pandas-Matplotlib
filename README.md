# TASK-06-Data-Analysis-using-SQLite-Python-Pandas-Matplotlib
This project demonstrates how to work with a SQLite database, execute SQL queries, load results into Pandas, and visualize data using Matplotlib.

Steps :-

Create SQLite database and table.

Insert sample sales data.

Run SQL using SUM() and GROUP BY to calculate revenue + quantity.

Load SQL output into Pandas DataFrame.

Visualize revenue by product using Matplotlib bar chart.

Key Insights:-

Products show different revenue levels.

Top product generates the highest revenue after grouping.

Higher price × quantity drives revenue, not just quantity.

GROUP BY and SUM() summarize data effectively.

Visualization makes product comparison easy and clear.
